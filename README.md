## How to use

#### LobbyMaker

With this class you can create, list and join lobbies
They can have password or be private (joined by name)

```
const { LobbyMaker } = require('@mxve/matchmaking');

function runGame(players) {
	console.log("Game started with:");
	console.log(players);
}

function getPlayerKey(player){
	return player.id;
}

let lobby = new LobbyMaker(runGame, getPlayerKey);

let player1 = { id:20 }
let player2 = { id:21 }

// Create a room
let id = lobby.createRoom(player1, "Room 0");

// Other player joined the room
lobby.joinRoom(id, player2);

// Start game
lobby.start(id);

// Game started with:
// [ {id:20}, {id:21} ]

```

#### FifoMatchMaker

This one is really simple, just push players to the queue, and games will be started automatically!

```
const { FifoMatchmaker } = require('@mxve/matchmaking');

function runGame(players) {
	console.log("Game started with:");
	console.log(players);
}

function getPlayerKey(player){
	return player.id;
}

let mm = new FifoMatchmaker(runGame, getPlayerKey, { checkInterval: 2000 });

let player1 = { id:1 }
let player2 = { id:2 }

// Players join match queue
mm.push(player1);
mm.push(player2);

// When there are enough players, runGame will be called

// Game started with:
// [ {id:1}, {id:2} ]

```
